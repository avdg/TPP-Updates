            <h1>Live Update Commands</h1>
            <p>Live updates are published by talking to an IRC bot on Freenode.</p>
            <h2>Getting set up on Freenode</h2>
            <p>Freenode is an IRC chat network. We can use it to talk to each other about moderation and live updates, as well as talk to
            a bot that will publish live updates. To connect to Freenode, you should have a client:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://hexchat.github.io/">HexChat</a> for Windows</li>
                <li><a href="http://colloquy.info/">Colloqy</a> for OS X</li>
                <li><a href="http://weechat.org/">WeeChat</a> for Linux (HexChat if you want a GUI)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pick your client and tell it to connect to Freenode (your client should have Freenode set up automatically, but if not, it's chat.freenode.net).</p>
            <p>Each IRC network (like ours, Freenode) consists of several IRC channels. These are chat rooms, with several people chatting in a single channel.
            The Freenode channel for discussing TPP is called #twitchplayspokemon, and we use a private channel called #tppmods to publish live updates and talk
            with each other. To join a channel, type <code>/join #channelname</code>. You'll need to be fully set up before you can join #tppmods, though.</p>
            <p>Speaking of getting fully set up, we need to establish who you are. Basically, we can't have any old person updating the site - it'll turn into a
            spamfest right away. To do so, you'll need to register (it's easy): <code>/msg NickServ help register</code>. Once that's out of the way, you'll
            need an "unaffiliated cloak", which protects your IP and makes sure the bot can consistently identify you (also pretty easy). Type <code>/join #freenode</code>
            and ask: "Can I get an unaffiliated cloak?". You can mention one of the people with + or a dot next to their names if no one is paying attention.</p>
            <p>Once you're identified and cloaked, you're good to go. You need to use <code>/msg NickServ identify password</code> with your password whenever you
            connect to the network to make sure you're logged in. You can make your life easier by looking around in your IRC settings for the server username and
            password and putting them in there instead. Send a message to SirCmpwn (<code>/msg SirCmpwn your message here</code>) and ask to be invited to #tppmods.</p>
            <h2>Talking to the bot</h2>
            <p>To talk to the bot, just say one of these commands in any channel PokeBot is in (includes #tppmods). You can also send these to PokeBot in a private
            message (like <code>/msg PokeBot .levelup Pikachu</code>).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>.update category "title" "description" time</strong>: Categories are Travel, Roster, Items, Battle, Commentary, Meta. Time and description optional, default time is the time the update was published.</li>
                <li><strong>.levelup pokemon</strong>: Levels up a Pokemon.</li>
                <li><strong>.catch "species" level "in-game name" "nickname"</strong>: Adds a Pokemon. Do not use this if the Pokemon is immediately boxed. Add moves with:</li>
                <li><strong>.learn pokemon "move"</strong>: Adds a move to a Pokemon's moveset.</li>
                <li><strong>.forget pokemon "move"</strong>: Forgets a move.</li>
                <li><strong>.release pokemon</strong>: Also used for boxing Pokemon.</li>
                <li><strong>.pickup "item"</strong>: Adds this item to our inventory.</li>
                <li><strong>.drop "item"</strong>: Drops/uses an item.</li>
                <li><strong>.goal "goal"</strong>: Updates the goal.</li>
                <li><strong>.badge "name"</strong>: Acquires a badge.</li>
                <li><strong>.money amount</strong>: Money.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Times are noted in the form of "1d1h1m1s"</p>
            <p><strong>Remember to use the quotes where required!</strong></p>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>You want to make a comment on how the battle's going down: <code>.update commentary "Bird Jesus poisoned" "Bird Jesus is in some trouble, let's hope he pulls through"</code></p>
            <p>This sets the title of the update to "Bird Jesus poisoned", and the extended commentary is "Bird Jesus is in some trouble..."</p>
            <p>Say we catch a pidgey: <code>.update roster "Red catches a Pidgey"</code>. This doesn't include an extended description - it's optional.</p>
            <p>If you want to add an event in the past, try something like: <code>.update battle "Red vs Blue, Blue wins" "Description goes here" 4d5h3m10s</code></p>
            <p>This will add the event at 4 days, 5 hours, 3 minutes, and 10 seconds from the start of Twitch Plays Pokemon (aka the timer shown on the stream).</p>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>If we use <i>or</i> drop an item, use <code>.drop "item name"</code> to indicate that change. Also, use <code>.catch</code> only when Pokemon are added to the
            party, and <code>.release</code> when Pokemon are removed from the party. Don't use it when we catch a Pokemon and send it to the PC. You <b>should</b> use 
            <code>.catch</code> and <code>.release</code> when we move Pokemon to/from the PC. It updates the party on the front page.</p>
            <p>One last thought: the only command that adds an update is <code>.update</code>. The rest modify the other parts of the live update page, like the inventory.</p>
            <h2>Update Categories</h2>
            <p>In an effort to organize things, we're trying to use each category for these things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Travel: Moving between routes, or cities, or dungeons (just an area change)</li>
                <li>Battle: The outcome of battles. Use commentary for updates for each battle</li>
                <li>Roster: Changes to the Pokemon we own. Released or caught.</li>
                <li>Items: Pick up, use, or drop items.</li>
                <li>Commentary: Live commentary, similar to pro sports commentary</li>
                <li>Meta: Important meta news, forced to show up even if the user turns off all other updates</li>
            </ul>
